            <p class="card_description">Donovan Edwards is an American football running back for the Michigan Wolverines. He has won three consecutive Big Ten Conference titles and a national championship in 2023. Edwards is the only player in college football history to have multiple 40-yard touchdown runs in a national championship game. Although his junior season was not as impactful as his sophmore year, he did answer the call when the Wolverines needed him.</p>

            <p class="card_description">Colston Loveland is an American football tight end for the Michigan Wolverines. He was a first-team All-Big Ten selection as a sophomore, winning a national championship in 2023. He is a tough player with better then exceptional hands, and if he stays healthy, and this only being his junior year, he can easily be selected in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft. Expect him to be a mentor for the younger Wolverines this upcoming season.</p>

            <p class="card_description">Alexander Orji is an American football quarterback for the Michigan Wolverines. He won a national championship with Michigan in 2023 but as a back-up QB, he currently is competing for the starting QB position for the upcoming season. He did see a fair share of playing time throughout the season, he played with a calm demeanor and displayed a strong arm passing with pretty good accuracy, and he has speed if he needs to leave the pocket. </p>
